        <h2><em>Career & Life</em></h2>
            <p>Shakur began his career as MC New York in 1989. He went under the stage name 2Pac in 1991 and appeared on the single, "Same Song" by <a href="https://twitter.com/humptyfunk">Digital Underground.</a> Following that, he went on to create multiple gold & platinum albums that would sell <strong>millions</strong> of copies.
                Outside of the music world, Shakur was able to step in the film industry. 
                Some of his roles include: <ul>
                    <li>Juice</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107840/">Poetic Justice</a></li>
                    <li>Above the Rim</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h2>Feud & Death</h2>
            <p>Tupac Shakur was known as the face of West Coast Rap. With that notoriety came with enemies, one of those included <strong>The Notorious B.I.G.</strong> (Christopher Wallace). Their relationship can be divided into three periods:
                <ol>
                    <li>Respect</li>
                    <li>Accusation</li>
                    <li>Rivalry</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Wallace would turn to Shakur for business advice and looked to Shakur as an older sibling. A sudden shooting incident would bring all of that to a close when Shakur was shot in the lobby of Wallace's studio. This would change these friends to enemies until both of their untimely deaths.
                On the night of September 07, 1996, Shakur was on his way back to his Las Vegas hotel room when he was shot four times and succumbed to his wounds four days later. He was 25 years old.
